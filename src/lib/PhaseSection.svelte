        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Phase One</strong> of the <strong class="bold-text">Marvel Cinematic Universe </strong>is composed of <strong>six movies</strong> introducing the main heroes and actors of the <strong>Infinity Saga</strong>: <strong>Tony Stark</strong> <em>(Robert Downey Jr.)</em>, <strong>Bruce Banner</strong> <em>(Edward Norton / Mark Ruffalo)</em>, <strong>Nathasha Romanoff</strong> <em>(Scarlett Johansson)</em>, <strong>Thor</strong><em> (Chris Hemsworth)</em>, <strong>Clint Barton</strong><em> (Jeremy Renner)</em>, and <strong>Steve Rogers</strong> <em>(Chris Evans)</em>.
          <br><br><strong>Nick Fury</strong> <em>(Samuel L.

        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Phase Two</strong> of the <strong class="bold-text">Marvel Cinematic Universe </strong>is composed of <strong>six movies</strong>, just like Phase One.
          <br><br>The first three movies of Phase Two continue the story of <strong>Tony Stark</strong>, <strong>Thor</strong>, and <strong>Steve Rogers</strong>.
          <br><br>The other three movies introduce many new important characters: <strong>Sam Wilson</strong> <em>(Anthony Mackie)</em>, <strong>Wanda Maximoff</strong> <em>(Elizabeth Olsen)</em>, <strong>Peter Quill</strong> <em>(Chris Pratt)</em>, and the other <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy</strong>, <strong>Vision</strong> <em>(Paul Bettany)</em>, and <strong>Scott Lang</strong> <em>(Paul Rudd)</em>.
          <br><br><strong>Steve Rogers </strong> and <strong>Peggy Carter</strong> <em>(Hayley Atwell)</em> appear in <strong>four</strong> movies.
          However, they are <strong>not central, connecting characters</strong> as <strong>Furry</strong> or <strong>Coulson</strong> were in the first Phase.
          <br><br>The movies cumulated <strong>$5.8 billion</strong> at the global box office.
          <br>‍<br><em class="italic-text">Note: Marvel also released TV shows on ABC and Netflix introducing important characters like Daredevil.
          They are not included in this visualization as they are not officially part of the three Phases of the Infinity Saga.</em>

        <p class="paragraph">With <strong>eleven</strong> movies, the <strong>Phase Three</strong> of the <strong class="bold-text">Marvel Cinematic Universe </strong>is by far the most <strong>ambitious</strong> and concludes the <strong>Infinity Saga.
          </strong><br><br>The <strong>initial Avengers</strong> are still central to the story.
          Even with no <strong>Iron Man</strong> movie, <strong>Tony Stark </strong> still plays a significant <em>(if not the biggest)</em> role alongside <strong>Steve Rogers</strong>, <strong>Natasha Romanoff</strong>,  <strong>Bruce Banner</strong>, and <strong>Thor</strong>.
          <br><br>Of course, it is impossible not to mention <strong>Thanos </strong><em>(Josh Brolin)</em>, who appears in <strong>two</strong> movies but <strong>ties </strong>all of the Infinity Saga <strong>together </strong>with the <strong>Infinity Stones</strong>.
          <br>‍<br><strong>Phase Three</strong> also introduces <strong>new</strong> crucial Marvel characters like <strong>Peter Parker</strong> <em>(Tom Holland)</em>, <strong>Stephen Strange</strong> <em>(Benedict Cumberbatch)</em>, <strong>T'Challa</strong> <em>(Chadwick Boseman)</em>, and <strong>Carol Danvers</strong> <em>(Brie Larson).
          </em><br><br>The movies cumulated <strong>$13.
          5 billion</strong> at the global box office.
          <strong>Avengers: Infinity War</strong> is the fifth, and <strong>Avengers: Endgame</strong> is the second of the <strong>highest-grossing films ever</strong>.
